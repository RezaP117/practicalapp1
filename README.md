I decided to examine the Restaurant(<20), Restaurant(20-50), Coffee, and Carry Out groups in more detail in my code.

I chose different factors to compare with each of them, primarily focusing on age, marital status, gender,
and frequency of which the customers visited that particular group.

For the Restaurant(<20) group, I decided to compare the coupons used ('Y' section of table being = 1) with gender, marital status, frequency, and if they have children. What I found about this group from the categories I compared was that customers who were
unmarried but still had partners and were in the age grou of below21 - 31 were the most likely to use the coupon (0.74%).
Another interesting point I found with this group was that gender didn't have much of an impact on which customer decided to use their
coupon on a cheap restaurant, both male and female had about a 70% accept rate on the coupon.

For the Restaurant(20-50) group, the main factor I wanted to consider was marital groups because I felt like this would have the most
impact on whether or not a person even goes to an expensive restaurant in the first place. However, to my surprise I found that no matter which marital groups I prioritized (singe, married, the rest) the percentage for accepting the coupon was low (between 40 and 46%).

For Coffee, I decided to use time and frequent visits as the main factor because I felt like this would heavily impact the results of using the coupon since most people get coffee in the mornings/afternoon and a lot of people make it a routine to get coffee before they start their day. My hypothesis was correct as I found that customers who visit more than 1 time and at the time of 10AM are very likely to use their coupon for coffee (81%).

Lastly for Carry out, I decided to use time and passanger for the main factors because these two things I feel like matter the most when someone is out and about wanting to get a quick meal. When I tested different times and passangers, I found that 2PM in general had a very high chance for the customer to use the coupon (86%), and I found that having a passanger that is a friend in the seat made this slightly higher at (88%).

If I were to continue with this dataset, I would urge the business to start sending more coupons to the carry out group and the coffee group that I evaluated immeditely, because these were by far the highest percentage groups of people who accepted the coupons. The next step I would probably take would be to do more analysis with the lower percentage groups and trying to find any patterns that could take their percentages higher with more refined conditions (using more specific groups) and then trying to generalize them.
